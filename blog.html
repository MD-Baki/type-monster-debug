                    <h2>Difference between local storage and session storage?</h2>
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>LocalStorage Persists The Storage Across Browser Sessions. So Even If The Domain Is Opened In A
                        New Tab, Or The Browser Is Closed And Reopened, The Storage Is Saved. There Is No
                        Expiration.<br><br>

                        SessionStorage Is Cleared When The Page Session Ends. A Page Session Lasts As Long As The Tab Or
                        The Browser Is Open. Therefore, When You Open A New Tab Or A New Window, This Creates A New
                        Session And New Storage.</p>

                    <h2>Difference between global scope and block scope?</h2>
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>A variable exists inside or outside a block. If a variable is declared outside all functions or
                        curly braces ({}), it exists in the global scope. The global variables can be accessed by any
                        line of code in the program, including inside blocks.<br><br>

                        This scope restricts the variable that is declared inside a specific block, from access by the
                        outside of the block. The let & const keyword facilitates the variables to be block scoped. In
                        order to access the variables of that specific block, we need to create an object for it.</p>

                    <h2>How does JavaScript's event loop work?</h2>
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>The event loop is a process that waits for the Call Stack to be clear before pushing callbacks
                        from the Task Queue to the Call Stack. Once the Stack is clear, the event loop triggers and
                        checks the Task Queue for available callbacks. If there are any, it pushes it to the Call Stack,
                        waits for the Call Stack to be clear again, and repeats the same process.</p>
