                    <h2>Difference between local storage and session storage?</h2>
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>LocalStorage Persists The Storage Across Browser Sessions. So Even If The Domain Is Opened In A
                        New Tab, Or The Browser Is Closed And Reopened, The Storage Is Saved. There Is No
                        Expiration.<br><br>

                        SessionStorage Is Cleared When The Page Session Ends. A Page Session Lasts As Long As The Tab Or
                        The Browser Is Open. Therefore, When You Open A New Tab Or A New Window, This Creates A New
                        Session And New Storage.</p>

                    <h2>Difference between global scope and blog scope?</h2>
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>A Block Scope Is The Area Within If, Switch Conditions Or For And While Loops. Generally
                        Speaking, Whenever You See {Curly Brackets}, It Is A Block. In ES6, Const And Let Keywords Allow
                        Developers To Declare Variables In The Block Scope, Which Means Those Variables Exist Only
                        Within The Corresponding Block.<br><br>

                        The Area Outside All The Functions Is Consider The Global Scope And The Variables Defined Inside
                        The Global Scope Can Be Accessed And Altered In Any Other Scopes.</p>
